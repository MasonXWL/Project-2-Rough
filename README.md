Project-2-Rough
===============

Hi Professor Brown. Below are a list of issues that I am trying to work around. I know all these issues can be answered in the notes, but I have looked through them all and just can't seem to find the things I am looking for.

- How do I center the Nav Bar
- How do I get fonts to display properly
- What is the way to correctly adjust font sizes if font size is universally selected already
- How do I properly size everything (width) etc to make sure everything is symmetrical and agrees with web design principle
- Any other noticeable flaws in my css files.

Thank you very much!
